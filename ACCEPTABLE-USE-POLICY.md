# openFEC API acceptable use
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) offers some of its public data in machine readable format via an Application Programming Interface (API). The FEC API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. The FEC operates openFEC. 

We encourage you to consume and use the API to discover new and innovative uses for FEC data. To maintain the availability of openFEC to serve FEC.gov and API users, we must place restrictions on how this data is accessed and used.
 
This acceptable use policy sets out a list of acceptable and unacceptable conduct for using openFEC, in addition to the restrictions imposed by the [terms of service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md). If we believe a violation of the policy is deliberate, repeated or presents a credible risk of harm to other users, the API or any third parties, we may suspend or terminate your access. If there is any inconsistency between this acceptable use policy and the terms of service, the terms of service will take priority to the extent of the inconsistency. 

## Changes to this acceptable use policy 
The FEC may update this acceptable use policy at any time. Updates will be made available on FEC.gov.
