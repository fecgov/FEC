## Campaign finance for everyone
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) releases information to the public about money that’s raised and spent in federal elections — that’s elections for US president, Senate, and House of Representatives. 

Are you interested in seeing how much money a candidate raised? Or spent? How much debt they took on? Who contributed to their campaign? The FEC is the authoritative source for that information.

betaFEC is a collaboration between [18F](http://18f.gsa.gov) and the FEC. It aims to make campaign finance information more accessible (and understandable) to all users.
