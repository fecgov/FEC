# FEC.gov road map
_Last updated: 5/30/2017_

The work on the new fec.gov will continue well after the initial launch. 18F and the FEC will continue this work using agile software development and user-centered design, continuously iterating and improving the product based on data and user feedback. 

To keep up with our day-to-day work, you can follow our Github issues, but for a higher-level view, we’re providing this public roadmap. This roadmap is always subject to change as we get new and better information; near-term plans are more concrete than long-term plans.

Here’s a glimpse of what is coming up in the near, medium and long-term.

## Near term: ~1 month

### Candidate and committee page enhancements
We have several improvements planned for candidate and committee pages, including additional data visualizations and additional columns of data when browsing committee filings.

### Finance data browsing improvements
We will continue to add filters to the advanced data pages. Some filters we have planned include a line number filter for receipts and disbursements and a ZIP code filter for receipts. 

### Additional content for candidates and committees
Just as we did with information for candidates and candidate committees, we will be reorganizing and improving the guidance content for other types of entities. We’re starting with content for party committees and then content for nonconnected PACs.

## Medium term: ~1-4 months

### Finance data browsing improvements
We will be investigating ways to expand the current two-year time period for browsing receipts and disbursements to allow users to search across more years at a time. We will also continue to add new filters, columns, and sortable properties to the data table pages to make it easier to get the data you need.

### Advisory opinion enhancements
Planned advisory opinion enhancements include adding the plain language summaries to canonical pages, adding additional filters, and continuing to refine the user experience of browsing and reading AOs.

### Election data and information comparison 
We will be working to present additional views of election-level financial totals and an improved way to find the most relevant information for a given state.  

### More *Help for candidates and committees* content
We will continue to build out the *Help for candidates and committees* section by providing reporting examples. 

### Additional legal resources
We will be enhancing the experience of browsing Matters Under Review to be consistent with the experience of browsing advisory opinions, adding a better presentation of search results and additional filters. We will also be adding additional legal resources, such as closed administrative fine and alternative dispute resolution cases. 

## Long term

### More “Help for candidates and committees” content
We expect the work of building out the remaining sections of “Help for candidates and committees” to several months, and so this will continue to be a long term priority. The final section we will ship will be for corporations and labor organizations. 

### eFiling modernization
Beyond 2017, the FEC will pursue the recommendations made by 18F’s study on “Modernizing the e-filing experience and infrastructure” in order to improve the filing experience and improve the quality of data.
